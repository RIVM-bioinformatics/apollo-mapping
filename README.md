## Contribution guidelines
Apollo pipelines use a [feature branch workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow). To work on features, create a branch from the `main` branch to make changes to. This branch can be merged to the main branch via a pull request. Hotfixes for bugs can be committed to the `main` branch.

Please adhere to the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for commit messages. These commit messages can be picked up by [release please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) to create meaningful release messages.
